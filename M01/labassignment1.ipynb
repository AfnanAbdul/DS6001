    "### Explanation:\n",
    "1. **Filtering Data**: The code filters the data by `work_year` to include only 2022 and 2023 and then by `job_title` to include only the specified job titles.\n",
    "2. **Grouping and Aggregating**: The `groupby` method groups the DataFrame by `work_year` and `job_title`. The `agg` function then computes the mean of `salary_in_usd` for each combination of `work_year` and `job_title`.\n",
    "3. **Reset Index**: `reset_index` is used to convert the grouped indices back into columns for a cleaner DataFrame.\n",
    "4. **Output**: The final DataFrame shows the average `salary_in_usd` for each combination of `work_year` and `job_title`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the provided dataset does not have entries for 2022 or for the specified job titles, the output will be empty. If you use a more complete dataset including 2022 or matching job titles, this code will produce meaningful results.\n",

    "1. **Filtering**: The same filtering steps are applied to include only the rows for 2022 and 2023 and the specified job titles.\n",
    "2. **Grouping and Aggregating**: The data is grouped by `work_year` and `job_title`, and the average `salary_in_usd` is calculated for each combination.\n",
    "3. **Pivoting**: The `pivot` method is used to reshape the DataFrame so that the `work_year` values become column headers. The `index` parameter is set to `job_title`, and the `values` parameter is set to `salary_in_usd`.\n",
    "4. **Renaming Columns**: The column names are modified for better readability. The original `columns` attribute of the pivoted DataFrame is adjusted to remove the multi-level index created by `pivot`, and it’s renamed to more descriptive labels.\n",
    "5. **Output**: The final DataFrame displays the average `salary_in_usd` for each job title with separate columns for each year.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the example data does not include 2022 and only the \"Data Scientist\" job title matches our specified list, the resulting table will reflect those constraints.\n",

    "It is interesting to observe how efficint the responses are when the prompt is crafted with a sample data, broken into managable tasks, and building upon step-by-step. Doing this excercise made me appreciate the importance of the prompt engineering skill and why it is essintial to learn in today's world. Although it might be tempting, given how easy it is, to rely entirely on ChatGPT to do all of this work, it's crucial to understand and learn the inner workings of the methods and attribues used. Prompt Engineering is a powerful tool in our toolkit, but it is important to remember it is just that—a tool."
